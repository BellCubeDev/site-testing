# BellCubeDev.GitHub.IO

This repository is the website for BellCube Dev, a mod author and occasionally a utility developer.

## About the Setup

This setup was cloned from [LOOT](https://github.com/LOOT), who already did most of the setup work for me. Huge thanks to the LOOT team!

> The static website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that uses [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/) components and the [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) and [Github.js](https://github.com/michael/github) libraries, which are provided by Google, Cloudflare and unpkg CDNs respectively.
