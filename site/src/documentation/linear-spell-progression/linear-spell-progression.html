<h1>Linear Spell Progression</h1>

Linear Spell Progression (LSP) is a framework developed by me, BellCube Dev, for easily and conflictlessly adding spell prerequisites. You can read about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link documentation/linear-spell-progression/how-it-works.html %}">How It Works - For Nerds</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link documentation/linear-spell-progression/linear-spell-progression.html %}">Creating a Plugin</a> here on this wiki.

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<i>tl;dr: This is probably the most compatible mod with a plugin in your entire load order</i>
<br />
Linear Spell Progression is designed in every aspect to be as compatible as possible. It makes a grand total of zero record overrides (in laymen's terms, it does not edit anything directly), it does not require any DLC, and it only takes action when directed to by other plugins.

<h2>Creating LSP Plugins</h2>

Designed with modularity in mind, LSP plugins are as simple to create as the engine allows, and can easily be done entirely through xEdit. See  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link documentation/linear-spell-progression/creating-a-plugin.html %}">the full guide</a> for the full run-down.
