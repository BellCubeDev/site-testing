<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<p>
    I'm BellCube, a modder who works on Minecraft and various Bethesda games and a moderator at Nexus Mods.
    <br>
    I also like to code stuff. I'm currently learning web development (oh hi) and I'll just learn something else after that.
    <br>
</p>

<h2> What I Know </h2>
<p>
    I primarily know TypeScript and Papyrus, though I have some experience with Lua. As for data formats, I can fluently write JSON and YAML, XML, and INI no problem. I can churn out HTML like it's nothing most of the time. CSS occasionally gives me some trouble, but nothing MDN can't fix. I can also write Batch and Powershell scripts relatively well.
    <br>
    If you need someone to right your regex, I'm your guy&mdash;I write it like a second language. I can usually figure out any given language if need be, but I prefer to use the ones I already know if possible.
    <br>
    <h3> The Bucket List </h3>
    In no particular order:
    <ul>
        <li> Getting familiar with databases (e.g. SQL) </li>
        <li> Learning C#, C++, Rust, and Python </li>
        <li> Accustoming myself to various JavaScript frameworks </li>
        <li> Familiarizing myself with the Linux command line </li>
    </ul>

    <style>
        rect[fill="#ddd"] {
            fill: #333;
        }
    </style>

    <div class="js-dom-svg" style="transform: scale(1.5) translateX(-26px); transform-origin: top left; height: 320px;"

<h2> Outside of Programming and Modding </h2>
<p>
    I'm a film student IRL. While I haven't published any work just yet, that may change at some point in the next three years. My all-time favorite game is Hollow Knight&mdash;the most perfect game known to man. I've got a backlog longer than the Pacific Ocean and twice as deep (thanks, Nexus!). I'm an English fanatic and can be found occasionally losing my last few drops of sanity over simple things like a missing comma.
</p>

<h2> Moderation </h2>
<p>
    On March 1st, 2023 at 10:18 AM EST, Nexus' community manager <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/31179975">Pickysaurus</a> contacted me via Discord to ask if I was interested in helping moderate Nexus Mods. I said yes after a bit of discussion and was officially knighted on the 6th. I strive to be fair and objective from the moment I open the reports panel, though I'm not perfect. I do my best to always back up my actions with direct citation from official Nexus policies and do my best to ask my fellow moderators and the Community Management team when I'm unsure of something.
    <br><br>
    Moderation is volunteer work, so I don't get paid for it. I do it because I mainly because I enjoy it, though the want to help make Nexus a better place for everyone certainly doesn't hurt.
    <br><br>
    If you ever want more information on how I moderate, feel free to <a href="#get-in-touch">ask me about it</a>. I'm always happy to answer as best I can and dig further if I can't!
