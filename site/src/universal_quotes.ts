/* (these variables are defined here so they aren't kept in memory the whole time)
We pull from the Conditionalized array before the Generic array to ensure that we always have some text.

Possible conditions:
time: An array of time bounds in 24hr [H,M].
random: A float between 0 and 1. If the Math.random number is less than this, the condition is met.
date: An array of date bounds in [M,D,YYYY]. Set either to [0,0,0] to mark it as unbounded.
