<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<p>
    I'm BellCube, a modder who works on Minecraft and various Bethesda games.
    <br /><br />
    This is my personal website&mdash;a place where I post documentation, tools, and updates on my projects. Maybe the occasional blog post? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    <br /><br />
    You can find some linky links in the Navigation to the left. A full-blown "About Me," a full section for Documentation, and some links to my GitHub and Nexus Mods profiles (hover your mouse over the Nexus Mods one!).
</p>
